# Statistic_Class
I recently implemented a custom Statistic class to calculate key statistical metrics like mean, variance, standard deviation, and skewness. This code is an excellent resource for anyone diving into data science, helping to break down complex data and gain meaningful insights.

Whether you're a beginner or experienced with Python, I hope this can be a useful tool for you to explore statistics programmatically.
